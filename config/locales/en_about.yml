        The online Bassi-Veratti Collection brings historical primary source materials to scholars and
        students around the world. It consists of an online interface offering access to the digitized
        versions of all of the materials of the Bassi-Veratti Collection at the Archiginnasio in Bologna.
        Access is via a detailed archival inventory, or finding aid. This inventory has been tagged so that
        researchers can search using keywords and index terms. Because the inventory’s contents are linked to
        the corresponding digital images, scholars can easily navigate from the descriptions of the materials
        to the digital facsimiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that this online archive contains only the materials found in the Bassi
        Veratti Collection in the Archiginnasio. Additional materials on Laura Bassi and her world can be
        found in other libraries and archives in Bologna and elsewhere, including important correspondence in
        the Archiginnasio's "Collezione degli autografi".
      </p>
      <h3>Technical summary</h3>
      <p>
        The inventory, or finding aid, was transposed by hand from a Microsoft Word document to Encoded
        Archival Description (EAD), an international standard XML schema maintained by the Library of
        Congress in partnership with the Society of American Archivists. EAD 2002, the latest approved
        version, allows the standardization of collection information in finding aids within and across
        repositories. As an XML schema, it affords an environment for tagging of key terms, which can be
        extracted and indexed to enhance discovery in a customized online environment. The Stanford
        University Libraries (SUL) team took advantage of the richly-described collection inventory created
        by Archiginnasio partners, and increased searchability of the collection by tagging both family and
        personal names, geographic locations and corporate names associated with the individual documents
        listed. This information, along with document dates harvested from the EAD XML, and a list of
        document types generated – were used to construct the indexes for the online discovery environment
        for the collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Digitization of the 672 items (6000 total images) in the Bassi-Veratti collection was conducted by
        Italian Vendor AdACTA s.r.l under the direction and guidance of digitization experts from SUL. Using an
        I2s Suprascan Digibook 10.0, AdACTA conformed to Stanford University Libraries (SUL) image file
        specifications to produce archival master TIFF files. Image files were compressed using TIFF 6.0 LZW,
        with a spatial frequency of 400 ppi, non-interpolated, a bit depth of 8 and an Adobe RGB (1998) color
        space. As specified by SUL, throughout the imaging workflow Image Science Associates Golden Thread
        targets were used by the vendor. This enabled the employment of thorough quality control by SUL’s image
        quality staff. Derivative JPEG 2000 images were generated from the master TIFF files, and re-purposed
        for viewing on the web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The images (TIFFs and JPEG 2000s) and associated metadata were assembled and accessioned into the
        <a href="http://library.stanford.edu/projects/stanford-digital-repository">Stanford Digital
        Repository</a> (SDR).
        The SDR ensures each digital object is preserved, made available via a persistent URL (web address),
        enforces content rights and restrictions and provides a common storage mechanism for other
        applications to build upon. Further, the SDR provides long-term preservation, access and management
        of content deposited by SUL partners. Through a combination of technologies and infrastructure as
        well as programmatic processes and policies, SDR offers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preservation – secure preservation environment designed to ensure the long-term availability,
        integrity and accessibility of content.</li>
        <li>Access – support for discovery, delivery and persistent citation of objects.</li>
        <li>Management – ability to administer and manage aspects of the content such as defining access
        control.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The collection web site was designed and developed using open source technologies that SUL
        development staff employ for all SUL discovery and access solutions. The Bassi-Veratti digital
        collection is built on top of the Stanford Digital Repository to provide a web based platform for
        discovery of archival documents and their associated descriptive information. The digital collection
        was developed in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> using <a
        href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a>. Blacklight provides the discovery interface and
        uses an Apache Solr index, constructed by mining the Bassi EAD XML for relevant data elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Providing users with a fast and versatile means of smoothly viewing, zooming, and panning large,
        high-resolution images of manuscript pages was a critical challenge for the project. The image
        presentation component of the site takes advantage of JPEG2000 image file compression and an image
        server application that dynamically decodes JPEG2000 files for viewing and manipulation in the web
        browser without the need for plug-in or other third-party software.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bassi-Veratti Collection web site design is based on a user-centered approach taken by SUL to
        develop online collection websites. This methodology involves early and iterative feedback from the
        primary audience of SUL’s online collections – academic researchers. It results in a web application
        that helps them achieve their research goals and increases the efficiency of the software development
        process. This comprehensive process includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interviews with key researchers – faculty, staff and students</li>
        <li>Persona development, enabling creation of in-depth character sketches, which not only describe
        research goals and behaviors, but also some personal characteristics</li>
        <li>Design, including the organization of content and functions on the web site, and any
        site-specific requirements</li>
        <li>Wireframes, or sketches of the web site pages, and overall visual design</li>
      </ul>

        Laura Bassi (1711-1778) was one of the most important and visible scientific women in
        eighteenth-century Europe. In 1732 she was the second woman to receive a university
        degree in Europe and the first to be offered an official university teaching
        position, both at the University of Bologna. She was the first female member of the
        Bologna Academy of Sciences, one of Italy’s leading academies, and played a
        significant role in the spread of Newtonian experimental physics through her
        teaching, research, and correspondence. While little documentary evidence of her own
        scientific work survives, she nonetheless had an active program of research and
        experimentation for many decades and was widely reputed to be an outstanding teacher
        of experimental physics. Bassi carried on extensive correspondence with other natural
        philosophers of her time, including Alessandro Volta, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Giovanni
        Battista Beccaria, Jean-François Nollet, Voltaire, and Francesco Algarotti.
      </p>
      <p>
        Encouraged in her studies by her family and by the intellectual community of Bologna, at
        the age of twenty she was invited to give a public debate on 49 philosophical and physical
        theses. Not long after this success, she received a special doctorate from the University
        of Bologna, followed soon after by an ex officio appointment to a chair in philosophy at
        the university. In Bologna she presented dissertations on subjects such as gravity,
        refrangibility, mechanics, and hydraulics. With her husband, Giuseppe Veratti, she made
        Bologna a center for experimental research in electricity. Laura Bassi was a high-profile
        public figure who debated frequently in public, appeared regularly at Bologna’s annual
        public anatomy dissection held during Carnival attracted high-profile visitors to Bologna
        from across Europe, wrote poetry for important public functions, and enjoyed the patronage
        of many contemporaries. Despite her public presence, however, most of Bassi’s teaching and
        research took place in her home, where from 1749 until her death, she and her husband
        established a laboratory, taught classes in experimental physics and natural philosophy,
        and presided over a lively scientific “salon.” In 1776 she was named professor of
        experimental physics at the Bologna Academy of Sciences, with her husband as her assistant.
        Giuseppe Veratti, her husband and intellectual partner, took over the professorship when
        his wife died only two years later; while Laura Bassi was celebrated during her lifetime
        and is the focus of current research, we lack any studies of him. Their youngest son Paolo
        Veratti continued to teach experimental physics from the family physics study but never
        entirely attained the success of either parent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bassi-Veratti Collection at the Archiginnasio is key to any research on Laura Bassi,
        her husband Giuseppe Veratti, and their family. Given her busy life as scientist,
        educator, poet, wife, and mother, Laura Bassi’s published output does not reflect the full
        scope of her accomplishments. Only the public disputations that launched her career and
        four treatises in the Commentarii of the Academy of Sciences were published. We know that
        during her lifetime she was a celebrated figure in the intellectual life of Bologna and
        that she played an important role in spreading Newtonian ideas of physics and natural
        philosophy in Italy in the eighteenth century, but less about her daily activities and
        those of her family. The Bassi-Veratti Collection consists of 12 boxes. Four boxes contain
        legal documents and deeds of both families; two are devoted to materials on Laura Bassi,
        and the rest hold materials about her husband Giuseppe Veratti, their son Paolo who became
        a physician and an experimental physicist and like both parents, professor at the
        University of Bologna, as well as additional family papers on the Bassi and especially the
        Veratti families. These papers were donated to the Archiginnasio in 1922-1924. In addition
        to scholarly writings and legal papers, the archive holds correspondence and poetry
        written in honor of accomplishments and noteworthy events in Bassi’s life as well as
        materials commemorating her death, printed publications by and about the family members, a
        commemorative medal from 1732 and the stamp used to make it, as well as a copper engraved
        portrait of Laura Bassi.

      <p>
        The online Bassi-Veratti Collection is a multi-year collaboration of the Stanford
        University Libraries, the Biblioteca Comunale dell’Archiginnasio di Bologna, Italy,
        and the Istituto per i Beni Artistici, Culturali e Naturali della Regione
        Emilia-Romagna, to produce a digital version of the archive of the influential
        eighteenth-century woman scientist, Laura Bassi. Part of the rich collections of the
        Archiginnasio, the archive contains not only materials about Laura Bassi, but also
        those of her husband, scientist Giuseppe Veratti, their children, and his family.
      </p>
      <p>
        The online Bassi-Veratti Collection was first conceived in 2010 through discussion between
        the Stanford University Libraries, the Archiginnasio, the IBC Soprintendenza of the Region
        of Emilia-Romagna, and Stanford Professor of History, Paula Findlen. Its development has
        truly been a international collaboration, with the Archiginnasio providing the archive
        itself, its inventory and expertise about the collection’s contents, history, and
        arrangement, and Stanford librarians and digital technology specialists transforming the
        inventory into a digital finding aid, managing the digitization work from afar, and
        conceptualizing and creating the bilingual interface. The IBC has provided constant
        support for the initiative, thanks to considerable experience gained through international
        projects.
