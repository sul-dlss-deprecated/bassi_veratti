        The online Bassi-Veratti Collection is a multi-year collaboration of
        the Stanford University Libraries, the Biblioteca Comunale
        dell’Archiginnasio, Bologna, Italy, and the Istituto per i Beni
        Artistici, Culturali e Naturali della Regione Emilia-Romagna, to produce
        a digital version of the archive of the influential woman scientist,
        Laura Bassi. Part of the rich collections of the Archiginnasio, the
        collection contains not only materials about Laura Bassi, but also those
        of her husband, scientist Giuseppe Veratti, their children, and his
        family.

        The Bassi-Veratti Collection is being built on top of the Stanford
        Digital Repository to provide a web based platform for discovery and
        study of the archive. The Collection is developed in

        Laura Bassi (1711-1778) was one of the most important and visible scientific women in
        eighteenth-century Europe. In 1732 she was the second woman to receive a university
        degree in Europe and the first to be offered an official university teaching
        position, both at the University of Bologna. She was the first female member of the
        Bologna Academy of Sciences, one of Italy’s leading academies, and played a
        significant role in the spread of Newtonian experimental physics through her
        teaching, research, and correspondence. While little documentary evidence of her own
        scientific work survives, she nonetheless had an active program of research and
        experimentation for many decades and was widely reputed to be an outstanding teacher
        of experimental physics. Bassi carried on extensive correspondence with other natural
        philosophers of her time, including Alessandro Volta, Lazzaro Spallanzani, Giovanni
        Battista Beccaria, Jean-François Nollet, Voltaire, and Francesco Algarotti.

        Encouraged in her studies by her family and by the intellectual community of Bologna, at
        the age of twenty she was invited to give a public debate on 49 philosophical and physical
        theses. Not long after this success, she received a special doctorate from the University
        of Bologna, followed soon after by an ex officio appointment to a chair in philosophy at
        the university. In Bologna she presented dissertations on subjects such as gravity,
        refrangibility, mechanics, and hydraulics. With her husband, Giuseppe Veratti, she made
        Bologna a center for experimental research in electricity. Laura Bassi was a high-profile
        public figure who debated frequently in public, appeared regularly at Bologna’s annual
        public anatomy dissection held during Carnival attracted high-profile visitors to Bologna
        from across Europe, wrote poetry for important public functions, and enjoyed the patronage
        of many contemporaries. Despite her public presence, however, most of Bassi’s teaching and
        research took place in her home, where from 1749 until her death, she and her husband
        established a laboratory, taught classes in experimental physics and natural philosophy,
        and presided over a lively scientific “salon.” In 1776 she was named professor of
        experimental physics at the Bologna Academy of Sciences, with her husband as her assistant.
        Giuseppe Veratti, her husband and intellectual partner, took over the professorship when
        his wife died only two years later; while Laura Bassi was celebrated during her lifetime
        and is the focus of current research, we lack any studies of him. Their youngest son Paolo
        Veratti continued to teach experimental physics from the family physics study but never
        entirely attained the success of either parent.

        The Bassi-Veratti Collection at the Archiginnasio is key to any research on Laura Bassi,
        her husband Giuseppe Veratti, and their family. Given her busy life as scientist,
        educator, poet, wife, and mother, Laura Bassi’s published output does not reflect the full
        scope of her accomplishments. Only the public disputations that launched her career and
        four treatises in the Commentarii of the Academy of Sciences were published. We know that
        during her lifetime she was a celebrated figure in the intellectual life of Bologna and
        that she played an important role in spreading Newtonian ideas of physics and natural
        philosophy in Italy in the eighteenth century, but less about her daily activities and
        those of her family. The Bassi-Veratti Collection consists of 12 boxes. Four boxes contain
        legal documents and deeds of both families; two are devoted to materials on Laura Bassi,
        and the rest hold materials about her husband Giuseppe Veratti, their son Paolo who became
        a physician and an experimental physicist and like both parents, professor at the
        University of Bologna, as well as additional family papers on the Bassi and especially the
        Veratti families. These papers were donated to the Archiginnasio in 1922-1924. In addition
        to scholarly writings and legal papers, the archive holds correspondence and poetry
        written in honor of accomplishments and noteworthy events in Bassi’s life as well as
        materials commemorating her death, printed publications by and about the family members, a
        commemorative medal from 1732 and the stamp used to make it, as well as a copper engraved
        portrait of Laura Bassi.

        The online Bassi-Veratti Collection is a multi-year collaboration of the Stanford
        University Libraries, the Biblioteca Comunale dell’Archiginnasio di Bologna, Italy,
        and the Istituto per i Beni Artistici, Culturali e Naturali della Regione
        Emilia-Romagna, to produce a digital version of the archive of the influential

      <p>
        The online Bassi-Veratti Collection was first conceived in 2010 through discussion between
        the Stanford University Libraries, the Archiginnasio, the IBC Soprintendenza of the Region
        of Emilia-Romagna, and Stanford Professor of History, Paula Findlen. Its development has
        truly been a international collaboration, with the Archiginnasio providing the archive
        itself, its inventory and expertise about the collection’s contents, history, and
        arrangement, and Stanford librarians and digital technology specialists transforming the
        inventory into a digital finding aid, managing the digitization work from afar, and
        conceptualizing and creating the bilingual interface. The IBC has provided constant
        support for the initiative, thanks to considerable experience gained through international
        projects.
